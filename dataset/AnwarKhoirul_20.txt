BICM-ID for Relay System Allowing Intra-link
Errors and a Similarity Constellation to ARQ
Schemes

Issue Date 2012-03

Abstract| In this paper, we propose an accumulator-assisted (ACC) relay system with bit-
interleaved coded modulation using iterative decoding (BICM-ID) technique and apply the net-
work topology to an Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ) scheme. Our code design is based on the
analysis of the extrinsic information transfer (EXIT) chart. The ACC enables the convergence
tunnel of the EXIT curves opening until almost the (1, 1) point of the mutual information, which
avoids the error Åãoor. The most advantageous point of the proposed technique is that even though
errors may happen in the intra-link (source-relay), they can be corrected at the destination by
exploiting the correlation knowledge between the source and the relay nodes. This technique
signiÅPcantly reduces the complexity of the relay where the source bits are simply extracted, even
though errors may occur due to the imperfect channel. The error rate of the intra-link can be
estimated at the destination node by using the a-posteriori Log likelihood Ratios (LLRs) of the
two decoders. Then, it can be further utilised in the iterative processing. Since the relay location
directly inÅãuences the quality of the intra-link, we change the relay locations, and provide the
analysis of the performances corresponding to diRerent relay locations. The theoretical back-
ground of this technique is the Slepian-Wolf/Shannon theorem for correlated source coding. The
simulation results show that the bit-error-rate (BER) performances of the proposed system are
very close to theoretical limits supported by the Slepian-Wolf/Shannon theorem. In this paper,
it is also shown that if the intra-link is error free, the topology of the relay network is equivalent
to an ARQ scheme that exploits Shannon's random coding theorem by utilising an interleaver in
the framework of ARQ. Based on this observation, results of simulations conducted to evaluate
the throughput of an ARQ scheme are presented.
1. INTRODUCTION
General relay systems usually consist of three basic components, source, relay nodes and a common
destination node. SpeciÅPcally, the transmitter is able to broadcast the information to both the
relay and the destination nodes. The relay receives signals from the source and re-transmits them
to the destination, by using diRerent strategies. The signals from both the source and the relay
sides can be received at the destination, while in diRerent time slots.
Since the intra-link (source-relay link) of relay systems is always intractable to deal with, it
is assumed to be error free in most of the works so far. In [1], an LLR updating function is
used at the receiver by exploiting the source-relay correlation, represented by the intra-link error
rate, in order to enhance the system performances. Based on this contribution, we adopt the Bit-
Interleaved Coded Modulation using Iterative Decoding (BICM-ID) technique [4] for higher order
modulation schemes. Moreover, we also show that if the intra-link is error free, the topology of
the relay network is equivalent to an Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ) scheme, where the relay
re-transmits the incorrectly-detected frame of the prior transmission. Here we exploit Shannon's
random coding theorem to achieve the best performance by utilising an interleaver between the
ÅPrst and second transmissions in order.
This paper is organised as follows. The relay system mode is introduced in Section 2. The
proposed decoding method and the BICM-ID technique are described in Section 3. In Section 4,
the EXIT Chart analysis and the results of the BER simulations are provided. Based on above, a
simple ARQ scheme is presented in Section 5. Finally, the conclusions are given in Section 6. All
the channels are assumed to suRer from the Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) through our
discussions. The subscripts 2sr, 2sd, and 2rd are used to indicate the source-relay, source-destination
and relay-destination links, respectively.
2. SYSTEM MODEL
There is one simple relay in the proposed system, operating in a half-duplex mode. During the ÅPrst
time slot, the transmitter broadcasts the signals to both the relay and the destination nodes. After
282 PIERS Proceedings, Kuala Lumpur, MALAYSIA, March 27{30, 2012
receiving signals from the source, the relay only extracts the data in a simple way while containing
some errors. In the second time slot, the relay re-encodes the extracted data and re-transmits them
to the destination.
Three scenarios of diRerent relay locations are considered in this paper, as shown in Fig. 1(a).
The relay can be allocated closer to the source or to the destination, or three nodes keep a same
distance, d, with each other. The geometric-gain of the source-relay link with regard to the source-
destination link can be deÅPned as:
Gsr =
É 
dsd
dsr
Å˜R
; (1)
where the path loss exponent R is assumed to be 3.52 [8] in our simulations. It is straightforward
to derive the geometric-gain of the relay-destination link Grd in the same way. Moreover, the
geometric-gain of the source-destination link, Gsd, is ÅPxed to one. Therefore the received signals
yij (ij 2 fsr; sd; rdg) at the relay and the destination node can be expressed as [8]:
ysr =
p
Gsr Åë hsr Åë s + nr; (2)
ysd =
p
Gsd Åë hsd Åë s + nd; (3)
yrd =
p
Grd Åë hrd Åë sr + nd; (4)
where s and sr represent the symbols transmitted from the source and the relay, respectively. The
fading channel gains, hij (ij 2 fsr; sd; rdg), are equal to one in AWGN channel. Notations nr and
nd represent the zero-mean AWGN noise vectors at the relay and the destination with variances ?2
r
and ?2
d, respectively. The signal to noise ratio (SNR) of source-relay and relay-destination links at
each location scenario are evaluated as follows: given the path loss parameter R equal to 3.52, we
have SNRsr = SNRsd + 21.19 dB and SNRrd = SNRsd + 4.4 dB in the location A; SNRsr = SNRsd
+ 4.4 dB and SNRrd = SNRsd + 21.19 dB in location B; SNRsd = SNRrd = SNRsr in location C.
The SNR without subscripts is with regard to the direct link (source-destination) in the following
discussions.
3. PROPOSED DECODING SCHEME
The diagram of the proposed relay system is illustrated in Fig. 1(b). In this paper, memory-1 half
rate (R = 1=2) systematic non-recursive convolutional code (SNRCC) is adopted for both encoders
C1 and C2. The original information bits at the source node are ÅPrst encoded by the C1, interleaved
by |1, doped-accumulated by ACC with a doping rate Pd1 and modulated using BICM. We use
4PSK and 8PSK for the modulation. The ACC has the same structure with the memory-1 half
rate systematic recursive convolutional code (SRCC). The output of the ACC is a systematic bit
sequence, where every Pd1-th bit is replaced by the corresponding coded bit [1] within that frame.
The code rate does not change after passing through it. The modulated symbols s are transmitted
to both the relay and the destination in phase one.

The received signals at the relay ÅPrstly go through the BICM demapper, ACC!1 and de-
interleaver |!1
1 . Then hard decisions of the source bits are made by the decoder D1. The Maximum
A-Posteriori (MAP) algorithm proposed by Bahl, Cocke, Jelinek, and Raviv (BCJR) is used for
decoding convolutional codes and the ACC. It's noticeable that the relay does not perform iterative
channel decoding in our proposed system. After that, the recovered bits are interleaved by |0 and
forwarded to C2 encoder, |2, and then ACC (with doping rate Pd2). Then the data are modulated
into sr, and transmitted to the destination during the second time slot.
At the destination node, the received signals ysd and yrd are ÅPrstly decoded via horizontal
iterations (HI) according to Fig. 1(b). Independently, the extrinsic LLRs obtained from the
two decoders D1 and D2 in HI are exchanged by several vertical iterations (VI) through an LLR
updating function fc [1]. Finally, hard decisions of the original information can be made based on
the a posteriori LLRs from D1.
When the relay is closer to the source, signals going through the intra-link suRer from noises
with less distortions. Errors at the relay node, with the probability Pr(b1 6= b2), may occur as
shown in Fig. 2. Obviously, for both 4PSK and 8PSK cases, channel decoding at the relay node
can achieve better BER performances. However, this advantage is not signiÅPcant for low SNRsr
scenarios. In this case, the systematic bits are simply extracted instead of performing channel
decoding. Consequently, the relay complexity can be further reduced without decreasing the system
performances.
3.1. BICM-ID Demapper
The extrinsic information at the receiver is exchanged between the demapper and the decoder,
through the HI. Further improvement of demapping can be achieved using the BICM-ID technique
by invoking the soft-decision feedbacks from the decoder's outputs [2]. The extrinsic LLRs of v-th
bit of symbol s after the demapper in AWGN channel can be expressed as
Le (sv) = ln P (sv = 1 j y)
P (sv = 0 j y)

where S1 and S0 denote the set of labeling have v-th bit being zero or one, respectively. M represents
the number of bits per symbol and La(sw) is the LLR fed back from the decoder corresponding to
the w-th position of the labeling patterns. The output LLRs of the demapper are then forwarded
to the ACC decoder.
3.2. LLR Updating Function
First of all, given the a posteriori LLRs of the uncoded bits, Lu
p;D1 and Lu
p;D2, from the decoders
D1 and D2, the intra-link error probability Pr can be estimated as [1]:
Pr =

p;D1 + eLu
p;D2
!
1 + eLu
p;D1
Åë !

p;D2
Åë; (6)
where N denotes the number of the a posteriori LLR pairs from the two decoders with suÅ}cient
reliability. Only the LLRs with absolute values greater than a given threshold can be chosen. The
284 PIERS Proceedings, Kuala Lumpur, MALAYSIA, March 27{30, 2012
threshold is set to one in our simulations. Based on the estimated error probability Pr given by
Eq. (6), the LLR updating function fc shown in Fig. 1(b) can be deÅPned as follows [5]:
fc(x) = ln
(1 ! Pr) Åë exp (x) + Pr
(1 ! Pr) + Pr Åë exp (x) ; (7)
where x denotes the input LLRs. The output of fc is the updated LLRs by exploiting Pr as the
correlation knowledge of the intra-link. The VI operations at the receiver can be expressed as [6]:

4. EXIT CHART AND BER ANALYSIS
The EXIT curves [3] of the HI loop with regards to the source-destination link's BICM-ID detector
using 4PSK and 8PSK are shown in Fig. 3(a) and Fig. 3(b), where HI was performed 50 times
in the simulations. During each HI, 5 times of VI take place between D1 and D2, which pushes
down the EXIT curves of the decoder towards the lower right side [1]. For the combined EXIT
curves of the demapper and the ACC!1, the x-axis represents the a priori mutual information (MI)
Ia(DeM +ACC!1), while the y-axis represents the extrinsic MI Ie(DeM +ACC!1). While for the
decoder's EXIT curves, the y-axis denotes the a priori MI Ic
a(D1) and x-axis denotes the extrinsic
MI Ic
e (D1). Each SNR value corresponds to a certain intra-link error probability Pr according to
Fig. 2. The ACC's doping rate Pd1 was properly chosen in order to get the best matching among
those tested values between the demapper's and decoder's EXIT curves, as shown in Fig. 3. In our
simulations, the doping rate Pd1 for the source-destination link and the Pd2 for the relay-destination
were set at 5, 3, 3 for the scenarios A, B and C, respectively, for 4PSK. They are set at 4, 2, 8 for
8PSK.
Figure 4 shows the BER performances of the proposed system with 4PSK and 8PSK modula-
tions. The frame length is 10000 in our simulations. Obviously, less SNR is needed to achieve the
turbo cliR when the relay is getting closer to the source node. It's noticeable that in location A,
the BER performances are almost the same when the relay either extracts the systematic bits or
performs the channel decoding.
As can be seen in Fig. 4(a) and Fig. 4(b), the SNR threshold happens at low energy values for
both the 4PSK and 8PSK modulations. Therefore, it is reasonable to rely on the Shannon/SW limit
calculation using the Gaussian codebook. According to [7], the Shannon/SW limit with Gaussian
codebook is !1:55 dB for 4PSK and 1.61 dB for 8PSK cases, both with the coding rate being
1/2. Therefore, the gaps of our proposed system are 2.75 dB and 2.89 dB for 4PSK and 8PSK,
respectively.

5. PROPOSED ARQ SCHEME
If the intra-link of our previous system is assumed to be error free, a similarity constellation of
a simple Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ) scheme can be developed: initially, the data frame is
sent from the source to the destination and the receiver only performs HI for detecting. If the
transmitter is acknowledged that the frame is correctly detected, it continues to transmit the next
data frame. However, if error happens in this frame, with frame error rate (FER) denoted by P1,
second transmission takes place. Unlike the conventional ARQ scheme, with our proposed scheme,
the frame should ÅPrst be forwarded to a random interleaver before being re-transmitted, which is
equivalent to the case when relay perfectly recovers the source bits and interleaves them before re-
encoding. The FER for the second transmission is represented by P2. Finally, if both transmissions
fail, the receiver works exactly the same as our proposed relay system, which combines VI and HI,
based on the received signals. Therefore, the FER P3, which is the result of the collaboration of HI
and VI decoding, can be signiÅPcantly reduced. Assigning selective repeat ARQ, the average system
throughput Tave is given by Eq. (10). The frame length is 4000 in our simulations and 10000 frames
are tested. The results using 4PSK are shown in Fig. 5; Fig. 5(a) shows SNR versus P1, P2 and
P3 and Fig. 5(b) shows SNR versus the average throughput.
Tave = R[(1 ! P1) + 0:5P1 (1 ! P2) + 0:5P1P2 (1 ! P1P2P3)]
= R[1 ! 0:5P1 (1 + P2P3)] (10)
where R denotes the coding rate, which is 1/2 in our simulations.
6. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we have proposed a novel technique that combines the BICM-ID with our proposed
relay scheme for higher order modulations, which allows the intra-link errors. The intra-link error
286 PIERS Proceedings, Kuala Lumpur, MALAYSIA, March 27{30, 2012
probability is regarded as the correlation knowledge between source and relay nodes, which can be
estimated and further exploited at the receiver by the LLR updating function fc due to the error
functions in the VI. Thereby, close-limit BER performances can be achieved without requiring
high complexity at the relay. In addition, a simple ARQ strategy has been proposed based on the
structure.
