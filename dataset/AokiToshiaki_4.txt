Extracting threads from concurrent objects for
the design of embedded systems

Issue Date 2002-08-05

Abstract
As a result of the increasing size and complexity of embedded
systems, object-oriented techniques are going to be
adopted in the embedded software development. In embedded
software developments, we have to consider nonfunctional
requirements such as real-time properties and
resource requirements. To deal with these requirements,
some methodologies design the system using a threadbased
approach. In such approach, we need to extract
threads from the concurrent objects defined in the analysis
model. However, current methodologies do not provide
enough support to do so. In this paper, we propose a formal
approach to extract threads from concurrent objects. We
also present an experimental application of the proposed
approach to the development of a device driver.
1 Introduction
Due to the increase in size and complexity of embedded
systems, object-oriented techniques are going to be
adopted in embedded software developments. However,
it is still difficult to solve some domain specific problems
in embedded systems. The main problems are to satisfy
non-functional requirements such as real-time and resource
constraints. In the existing object-oriented design, it is hard
to deal with these constraints.
In object-oriented developments, we analyze the target
system to specify the logical behavior of the system as a set
of concurrent objects. If we consider a system which do not
have severe non-functional constraints, like an enterprise
system, we can directly design and implement objects as
software modules which are performed concurrently. However,
this is not possible in embedded system developments
because of the existence of such constraints. Thus, we need
a design model which is suitable for analyzing severe nonfunctional
constraints.
Functions of a system are realized through the cooperation
of objects. Objects communicate with each other. The
execution process of a function can be represented as a
sequence of communication between objects as shown in
Figure 1. We call such a sequence a thread. Real-time
constraints are given to threads as deadlines.
Figure 1 shows the relationship between objects, threads
and real-time constraints.

1: Objects, threads and real-time constraints.
In the design of embedded systems, threads are modified
frequently to satisfy severe real-time constraints. If we
use an object-based model, the behavior of objects must be
changed to satisfy the constraints. In the worst case, we
have to divide, unify or remove the objects. It causes the
destruction of the logical structure of objects which are defined
in the analysis phase.
There are some development methodologies for embedded
systems which design the target system using a threadbased
approach. OCTOPUS[9] and SES approach[2] have
adopted a thread-based design approach. In these methods,
real-time properties are considered after threads are
extracted from an analysis model. However, they do not
provide enough support on how to derive a design model.
To obtain such design models, we propose in this paper
a transformation method from analysis model to design
model. In our approach, both analysis and design models
are defined by Concurrent Regular Expressions[ 1]. The
design model is derived from the analysis model using an
axiomatic system for equivalent transformation using concurrent
regular expressions. The equivalent transformation
is a transformation that changes the representation of the
models but never changes their behavior.
We also introduce an experimental application of our
method in the development of the PCM t device driver. This
driver supplies 3 channels PCM audio playbacks. Our main
objectives in this experiment are:
- to show that we can derive a design model with our
method in a real application development, and
- to show that we can implement code based on our design
model.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.
In Section 2 we introduce concurrent regular expressions.
Section 3 describes how to formalize analysis and design
models on concurrent regular expressions. In Section 4,
we introduce an axiomatic system for equivalent transformation
on concurrent regular expressions. Section 5 describes
an experiment in PCM device driver development.
Section 6 gives some conclusions and the directions of our
future work.
2 Concurrent Regular Expressions
In this section, we introduce Concurrent Regular Expressions(
CREs) which are used to formalize our analysis
and design models. CREs are used to model concurrent
systems. Vijay K. Garg and M.T. Ragunath proposed it as
algebraic descriptions of the language of Petri nets[1].
There are many existing algebraic specification methods
for concurrent systems such as process algebra CCS[7],
CSP[6] and ACP[8]. These methods model the states of a
system explicitly. A process is described as actions which
are performed at a state in a system. The system is defined
as a set of such processes and transition relationships between
them. On the other hand, CREs directly model the
behavior of a whole system. States in a system are ignored.
In our approach, we do not consider the states of a system.
Therefore, we choose simple CREs as our modeling
method.
CREs are extension of regular expressions with four
operators: interleaving, interleaving-closure, synchronous
Ana bbreviatioonf PlusC odeM odulation
compositiona nd renaming.I n thisp aper, we use only interleaving
and synchronous composition operators. We omit
to explain the other operators.
We model a system with the interleavingo perator if the
system consists of threads which are executed concurrently.
If the system consists of objects which communicate with
each other, we use the synchronousc ompositiono perator.
Let E be a finite set of symbols. Concurrent regular expressions
on E consist of symbols in E U {1,E} and operators:
choice(+), sequence(.), closure(*), interleaving(1)
and composition([S])I. and ? are the special symbols. I
means an empty set and E means an empty sequence. For
any expression P, P.1 = 1.P = 1 and P.6 = 6.P = P hold.
Expressions which contain no interleaving and synchronous
composition operators are the same as regular
expressions as known so far. The syntax of CREs on E
is defined as follows.
Definition 2.1 (Concurrent Regular Expressions)
1. cisa CRE ifcEEU{1,e}
2. P Q, P.Q and P* are CREs if P and Q are CREs.
3. P IQ is a CRE if P and Q are CREs.
4. P [S] Q is a CRE if P and Q are CREs and S C E.
5. (P) is a CRE if P is a CRE.
We define the priority of the operators as * > . > + >
> [s] . We can omit the parentheses in a CRE if it does
not become ambiguous. For example, we can simply write
a* .b -{- c instead of ((a*) .b) + c.
The meaning of a concurrent regular expression P is defined
as a set of sequences of symbols denoted by L(P). We
also call L(P) the language of P. The sequences of symbols
on E are defined as follows.
Definition 2.2 (Sequences)
1. c is a sequence if c E E U {E }
2. x ? y is a sequence if x and y are sequences.
For example, a b ? c is a sequences on E = {a. b, c}.
E in a sequence means the zero length sequence. For any
sequence x, ? ? x = x ? E = x holds.
The definition of L is as follows.
Definition 2.3 (The language of CREs)
Let a,b,c be a symbol in E. Let P, Q be CREs
w. x. y be sequences on E
1. L(1)=(2)
2. L(?) = {?}
onEand
3. L(c) = {c} ifc E E
4. L(P.Q) = {x - yIx E L(P), y E L(Q)}
S. L(P + Q) = L(P) U L(Q)
6. L(P*)=U1-o.1....LOP')
7. L(PII()= L(E111=3 )L (P)
8. L(413.Q)= L(a.EIIb.Q)L, (a.PIIb)= L(a.PIIb.()
9. L(a.PIIb.Q)= L(a.(PlIb.Q))U L(b.(a.PMQ))
10. L(PIIQ)= {wIxE L(P). y E L(Q)-w E L(2IIy)}
11. L(P[S]Q) = {wIw E (Ep U Eq)", w/(Ep U S) E
L(P), w/(EQ U S) E L(Q)}
12. L((P)) = L(P)
St is a regular expression which corresponds to a sequence
x. For example, x = a.b. c for x = a ? b - c. Ep is a set
of all symbols which appear on expression P. P i is defined
as the ith sequence of P. For example, P1 = P, P2 = P.P
and P3 = P.P.P, .... P‹ is defined as f for any P.
w/E means a restriction of w over E. For instance, a ? c -
a?d?a?b/{a,c}=a-c-a?a
The operator [S] is different from that of original CREs.
We extend the operator [ ] in the original CREs to [S]. The
original [ ] is the same as our [S] if S = d. In the remainder
of this paper, we use [ ] for [o].
We say that an operatorw has the distributivep ropertyi f
L((A+ B)wC)= L((AwC)+ (BwC))a lways holds. [ ] does
not have this property. For instance, L( (a + c) [ 1c) = {c}
but L((a[ ]c) + (c[ ]c)) = {a.c. c.a, c}
As a result of extending [ ] with S, we can give [S] the
distributivep roperty.S ee the distributivea xiom in Section
4.
3 Formalizing Analysis and Design Models
In this section, we formalize both analysis and design
models with CREs. We define the analysis model as concurrent
objects and the design model as concurrent threads.
We describe the behavior of a system with a set of action
sequences. Let us begin with the description of actions.
3.1 Action
An action means the atomic behavior of the system. We
define the action as an event, a method invocation or a fragment
of program code. Syntactically, an action is described
as a string.
Definition 3.1
An action is a string with lower-case character. The
string is sometimes with subscripts. For example, a, b, c,
ao, al . ---, an. open. close. post and get are actions.
3
3.2 Action Sequence
An action sequence is a set of ordered actions. Actions
are ordered following the time of their occurrence in the
system. If an action a occurs earlier than an action b, a
appears before b in an action sequence.
Consider a system which performs the actions
login. work and exit in this order. The behavior of the
system is defined as login work exit.
3.3 Behavior
The whole behavior of a system is defined as a set of
action sequences. We use a concurrent regular expression
to describe the set of action sequences.

open

s2
Figure 2: Automata
s3
Let us consider a system whose behavior is defined by
the automata shown in Figure 2. This automata starts at
the initial state so. After the action open occurs, its state
changes to s1. Then after the action read or write, the
system reaches the state s2. Finally, the action close occurrs
and the system reaches the final state s3. We can describe
such behavior with the action sequences open-read.
exit and open-write-exit. The behavior of the system is
defined by the set {open-read-exit, open-write ?exit}.
The behavior of a system could be too large and sometimes
defined by an infinite set of action sequences. It is
hard to write such a set directly. However, we can describe
the behavior using a notation that makes loops and switches
explicit. We use CREs as such a notation. CREs allow us
to describe loops with closure operators and switches with
choice operators.
By mapping actions to symbols on CREs, we can describe
the behavior of a system as the language of a CRE.
Intuitively,w e can write P.Qi f an action sequenceQ o ccurs
just after P. In the same way, P + Q means P or Q occurs
exclusively. P' means an arbitrary number of loops of sequence
P. When P and Q execute concurrently, we write
PIIQ . If there is communicationb etween concurrentP and
Q, P[ ]Q is used.
For example, the behavior of the automata shown in Figure
2 can be described with the regular expression:
open.(read+ write).close
The behavior corresponding to this expression is its language.
i.e.
L(open.(read write).close) =
{open ? read ? close. open ? write ? close}
3.4 Formalizing Analysis Model
An analysis model is defined as a system which consists
of concurrent objects. The objects communicate with each
other. Let 01.02. _On be regular expressions which means
behavior of objects in a system. The analysis model is defined
as follows.
O1[]02[]...[]On.
We omitted the parentheses on the expression above because
the associativel aw holds on [ ]. There is no 11o perators
in the expression for an analysis model. We call such
expression a concurrent object expression.
3.5 Formalizing Design Model
A design model is defined as a system which consists
of concurrent threads. There is no communication between
the threads. We formalize the design model with a concurrent
thread expression. A concurrent thread expression is
a concurrent regular expression without [ ] operators. For
example, a.b.cHd.c.f and a.(b11c).d are concurrent thread
expressions.
3.6 Formalizing Objects and Threads
Both objects and threads are defined as regular expressions.
In our models, objects and threads have no internal
concurrency. They are modeled in the same way except
for the communication between them. Objects run
concurrently and communicate with each other. On the
other hand, threads run concurrently without communicating
with each other.
3.7 Concurrency
Suppose that there is a system which consists of two
threads. P and Q are CREs which define the behavior of
the two threads in the system. These threads are executed
concurrently. Then, the behavior of the system is defined
as PHQ.
According to the language definition of that is, 7 to
10 in the definition of L, concurrent threads are a set of
interleaveda ction sequences of the threads. Suppose that
P = a.b and Q - c.d. Then, the behavior of the system
is a.blIc.d. L(a.blIc.d) represents all the interleaved sequences
of a.b and c.d. Therefore, L(a.blIc.d) =
{a?b?c?d.a?c?b?d.a?c?d?b.c?a?b?d.c?a?d?b.c?d?a?b}
3.8 Communication
Suppose that there is a system which consists of two
objects. P and Q are CREs which define the behavior of the
two objects in the system. These objects run concurrently
4
and communicate with each other. Then, the behavior of
the system is defined as P[ ]Q.
P[ ]Q has the same meaningsa s P 11Qif there is no communication
between P and Q. In P[ ]Q, the same symbols
appering in both P and Q are called communication symbols.
These symbols mean actions for synchronized communication
between P and Q. In our approach, all communication
between objects are synchronized communication.
Synchronizedc ommunicationi s a communicationb etween
objects which satisfies the following two rules:
- Objects block until the end of communication.
- No communication fails.
Assume that there are two objects defined as a.b and a.c
in a system and these objects run concurrently. If there is
no communication between the objects, the behavior of the
system is the following.
fa. ?a?b?c.a?b?a?c.a?b?c a.a?a?c b}
This behavior contains some sequences which do not
satisfy the synchronized communication rules. a ? b ? a ? c
and a ? b ? c ? a are such sequences. These sequences represent
the behavior where the objects did not block until the
end of the communication. There must be no symbols between
two communication symbols if the communication
succeed. In a ? b ? a ? c, there is the action b between the
communication symbol a. This sequence means that the
object a.b performs the action b before the object a.c finishes
a. In other words, a.b performs b without blocking
and waiting for object a.c to perform the action a. This
behavior violates the synchronized communication rules.
The [ ] operator deletes such behavior and leaves:
{a.a?b?c.a?a?c?b}.
It is clear in the set above that once a occurrs, the next
symbol is also a. So the [ ] operator reduces a.a to a. Finally,
we can get the set {a ? b ? c. a ? c ? b} as the meaning
of L(a.b[ ]a.c).
According to the synchronized communication rules,
communication must never fail. However, we can describe
an expression that violates this rule. For example,
in a.b.a[ ]a.b.c, the second occurrence of a in a.b.a cannot
communicate with a.b.c because a.b.c has only one
occurence of a. If communication fails in a system, the
whole behavior of the system becomes an empty set. Thus,
L(a.b.aHa.b.c) = o
4 Transformation
We define the transformation from an analysis model
to a design model as the transformation from a concurrent
object expression to a concurrent thread expression. This
transformation will never change the behavior of expressions.
In our approach, we achieve this transformation with
an axiomatics ystem for equivalentt ransformationo n concurrent
regular expressions.
4.1 Axiomatic System for Transformation
The axiomatic system which we propose has two rules
and 12 axioms for the [ ] operator. Table 1 shows the axioms.
In addition to these axioms, we need some axioms
on regular expressions which are known so far as algebraic
properties of regular expressions. There are 2 rules in this

Table 1: Axioms for equivalent transformation
axiomatic system. One is the rewrite rule and the other is
the reduction rule.
Let A and B be concurrent regular expressions. A '
B means that A and B are derivable from each other by
applying a rule. A '' B means A and B are derivable from
each other by applying some (more than zero) rules.
Definition 4.1 (Rewrite rule)
Let A, B and P be concurrent regular expressions.
- A B if A = B holds by axioms.
- P G P[A/B] if A B.
Note that P[A/B] is an expression where all A in P are replaced
with B. For instance, we can obtain a.Y.X, X.Y.a or
a.X.a from X.Y.X[X/a]
Definition 4.2 (Reduction rule)
Let S, A and B be concurrent regular expressions.

4.2 Soundness
Our axiomatic system defined above is

sound. In other
5
VP, P'.L(P) = L(P') if P P'.
holds. Therefore, two expressions have the same behavior
if one is derivable from the other.
4.3 Completeness
Sometimes, there are some CREs which have the same
behavior as another CRE. We say the axiomatic system is
complete if all equivalent CREs can be derived from an
expression. We define the completeness as follows.
VP.P'.P P' if L(P) = L(P').
5 PCM Device Driver Development
To evaluate our approach and to apply it in the development
of a real application, we developed the PCM device
driver using our approach. The driver is a synthesizer of
PCM data streams. It synthesizes some PCM data on the
fly so that some PCM channels can be played through only
one digital to analog converter called a DAC or D/A converter.
The PCM channel is an abstraction of a PCM data
stream to control its volume and frequency.
5.1 Target Environment
We suppose that the target system for this driver has the
following hardware.
- 1 CPU , 1 hardware clock and 1 DAC.
In addition, we assume that an operating system which
has at least the following functions are running on the system.
- I/O function: It is used to write a value from the driver
to the DAC.
- Interrupt handler: This function is used to notify an
event from hardware clock to software.
- Semaphore: It is used to implement the mutual exclusion
of threads in the driver.
We used C language for the implementation.
5.2 Driver Specification
Let us show the requirement specification for the PCM
driver.
- Play and stop up to 3 PCM channels concurrently.
- Frequency is changed for each channel.
- Volume is changed for each channel.
- Both frequency and volume are changed on the fly.
Application Interface (API) of the driver is shown in Table

objects with a concurrent object expression. Let us start by

Channel
We defined the behavior of objects as shown in Table 3.
The objects API, SYN, CLK and DAC in the Table 3 are instances
of classes API, Synth, Clock and D/A. The
driver plays 3 PCM channels concurrently, so three instances
of the class Channel are required. The objects

The actions play, stop, freq.vol in API correspond
to API entries. pi, si, fi and vi correspond to
play, stop, freq and vol the methods of CH,.
The action calc is an action which means communication
among CH0, CHi, CH2and SYN. The calc occurrs in
CH0, CH1i CH2 and SYN simultaneously. In this action, the
objects CH0, CH1 and CH2 calculate their output values and
SYN generates an output value for D/A from these 3 output
values. clk corresponds to the event from the clock.
write corresponds to the write method of the class D/A.

API is a class which represents the API entries of the
driver. Each method in API directly corresponds to a driver
entry.
Channel is a class for each channel. The methods
play, stop, freq and vol mean that start playing, stop playing,
change frequency and change volume for the corresponding
channel. calc is a method for calculating the
output value of the channel. Once calc is invoked, it generates
the output for 1 clock time.
Synth is a synthesizer for 3 channels and Clock is a
class for hardware clock. Synth is synchronized with
clock signals. Each time it synchronizes, it synthesized
an output value from the output values of all the channels.
Then, it writes the syhthsized value to the D/A converter.
- API invokes an appropriate channel after one of the
API entries is called. For example, one of the play
methods of the channel objects (po, P1 or p2) is called
after the API entry PLAY(play) is called.
- CHo, CH1 and CH2 start playing, stop playing, change
frequency, change volume or calculate their output
value repeatedly.
- SYN synchronizes with a clock event (clk) from
the hardware clock, then calculates the output value
(calc) and sends it to the D/A converter using the
write method.
- CLK generates a clock event repeatedly.
- DAC accepts the write action from SYN repeatedly.

5.3.3 Analysis Model
The design model for the PCM device driver is defined as
the following concurrent object expression.
API[ ] CH0][C H1][C H2][S YN][C LK][D AC
Note that we use the name of object instead of concurrent
regulare xpressions.F or example,s implyC LK[] DACis
the same as clock*[ ]write*.
5.4 Design Phase
In this section, we design the system. We derive concurrent
thread expressions from concurrent object expressions
using our axiomatic system. If we apply axioms only,
the steps for transformation are too large to complete by
hand. Let us show some theorems to decrease the size of
the transformations teps.

5.5 Transformation
We can transform the concurrent thread expression:
APIIISYN
from the concurrent object expression:
API[ ]CH0][C H1][C H2][S YN][C LK][D AC
We showt he outline of the transformationh ere.
First, we transform CH0[ ]C H1[ ]CH2.A ssume that CC 1
(p1 +- s1 + f i + v1) and by Theorem 5.2,
CH, = (CC, + calc)* 4 CCi[ ]calc~.
So, CH0[ [CH[I ,] CH2
CCo[] calc*[ ]CCi[] calc*[ ]CC2[] calc*
By associative law of [ ],
4 CCo[ ]CCi[ ]CC;[ ](calc*[ ]calc*[ ]calc*)
q CCo[] CC1[ CC;[] calc*
Next, we transform API[ ]CC*1.
peatedly,
CC, ' P [ ]si [ ]f i [ ]v
By using theorem 5.2 reSuppose
that X is an expression which holds (API 4
(play.pi + X)). By Theorem5.3,
API[ ]pi G (Play?P1 + X)*[ ]pi G (Play.Pi + X)*
For API [ ] s 1, f i or vi, we can transform with the same way
as API[ ]pi. API[ ]CCi q API[ ]pi[ ]si[ ]fi[ ]vi 4 API
Then,
API[] CCo[] CCi[ ]CC;q` API
Therefore,
API[] CH0][C H[1 ] CH2][S YN][C LK][D AC
q API[ ]calc*[ ]SYN][C LK][D AC
a API[ ]calc*[ ](clk.calc.write)*
q API[ ](clk.calc.write)*
q APIHSYN
5.6 Extracting Threads
In this section, we obtain subthreads from the design
model. An subthread can be directly implemented as a
function of C program code. In the implementation phase,
we implement our PCM driver based on subthreads.
As a result of the design, the behavior of the system is
defined as the two concurrent threads API and SYN. These
threads are still a little far from their implementation, so we
extract subthreads of API and SYN.
5.6.1 Subthreads
We model a subthread as a thread which has the following
two properties.
- A subthread is always ignited by an external event.
- Subthreads run exclusively if they belong to the same
thread.
The external event is an action which corresponds to an
event from outside of the driver.
Let us define the rule to obtain the subthreads.
Definition 5.1 (Subthreads)
Assume that T is a CRE and Pi is a regular expression.
Let eo , e i , .... en (n > 0) be actions which mean external
events.
eo?Po, el .P1, ...en.Pn are the subthreads of T
where T - (eo.Po + ei.Pi + ?.? en.Pn)*
5.6.2 Extracting Subthreads
Let us obtain the subthreads of API. In the thread API,
play, stop, freq and vol are the external events. All of
them occur when one of the API entries is called from
a client of the driver. According to the definition of subthreads,
we extract four subthreads PLAY, STOP, FREQ and
VOL shown in Table 4 from API.
8
Name
PLAY
STOP
FREQ
VOL
CLK
Expression
play.(po + pi + p2)
stop.(so + s1 + s2)
freq.(fo + fi + f2)
vol.(vo -}- v1 + v2)
clk.calc.write
Table 4: The subthreads of API and SYN
In the thread SYN, the action clk is an external event
because clk corresponds to an event from the hardware
clock. We extract only one subthread CLK shown in Table
4
5.7 Implementation Phase
We directly implemented the five subthreads of Table 4
as C the functions. See appendix to find the code. The
names of functions in the code are the same as the names
of the subthreads shown in Table 4.
5.7.1 Interface for External Event
A subthread is always invoked when an external event occurs.
There must be an interface that receives the external
event at the beginning of the subthread.
In the subthreads PLAY, STOP, FREQ and VOL, their external
events correspond to API invocation from clients
of the driver. We can represent the interface for external
events as C function entries themselves. The arguments of
the functions follow the API specification. For example,
API VOL has two arguments. One is the number of channel
and the other is the amount of volume. The declaration of
the function VOL is as follows.
void VOL(int ch, int value);
The subthread CLK is synchronized with the hardware
clock. We suppose that the operating system observes the
clock and it invokes the function CLK whenever the clock
event occurs. We registered the address of CLK to the operating
system as an interrupt handler for the hardware clock
when the driver is initialized. 2
5.7.2 Implementing the Body of Subthreads
We implemented the body of the functions taking into consideration
the meaning of each action. Each function is
filled with proper code. We also use some external variables
shared across the functions.
For example, VOL is a thread whose behavior is
vol.( vo + v1 + v2). We implemented the body of the function
as follows.
2This initialization code is omitted on the sample source .
void VOL(int ch, int value)
1
volume[ch]
}
value;
The variable volume is an array which stores the volume
of three channels. volume [ch] = value is an abbreviation
of following code.
switch(ch)1
case 0:
volume [0] =
break;
case 1:
volume[1] =
break;
case 2:
volume[2] =
break;
default:
/* ERROR */
break;
}
value;
value;
value;
This code fragment intuitively corresponds with (vo +vi +
v2).
5.8 Implementing the Mutual Exclusion
According to the result of the design, the threads
PLAY, STOP, FREQ and VOL never run concurrently. However,
we implement these four subthreads as functions.
They run concurrently if the external events come again
before the functions finish their processes. To prevent such
situation, we use a binary semaphore to make the functions
run exclusively.
We added some code to function PLAY, STOP, FREQ and
VOL. We wrote ENTER (sem) at the beginning of the functions
and LEAVE (sem) at the end of the functions. The
variable sem means a binary semaphore. ENTER is a function
which makes the semaphore up. The caller thread of
this function enters the critical section. LEAVE is also a
function which makes the semaphore down and the caller
leaves the critical section. Only one thread can enter the
critical section. The threads are blocked if the semaphore
is up when they enter. Threads wait until the semaphore is
down.
For instance, the function VOL is implemented as follows.
void VOL(int ch, int value){
ENTER(sem);
volume[ch] =
LEAVE(sem);
1
value;
Similarly, ENTER and LEAVE are added to the
PLAY. STOP and FREQ functions. Thus, PLAY, STOP. FREQ
9
and VOL share one semaphore and they are executed exclusively.
6 Conclusion
In this paper, we proposed the axiomatic system for the
equivalent transformation on CREs. Using this transformation
we can systematically obtain design models from
an analysis model. We applied our transformation method
to the PCM device driver development. Using our approach
we successfully derived a suitable design model
from the analysis model of the driver and we extracted a set
of threads from the design model and implemented them
using C language.
As a future work, we are planning to apply our approach
to larger and more complex systems. For the development
of such systems, the transformation steps become
extremely large. We will implement a system to help the
transformation.
