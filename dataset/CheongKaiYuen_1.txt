Abstract Without the use of computational assumptions uncondition
ally secure oblivious transfer 
OT is impossible in the standard model
where the parties are using a clear channel	 Such impossibilities can be
overcome by using a noisy channel	 Recently Palmieri and Pereira pro
posed a protocol based on random channel delays only	 Their scheme is
secure in the semihonest model but not in the general malicious model	
In this paper we study oblivious transfer in the same setting but we im

?? Introduction
Oblivious Transfer OT is a twoparty cryptographic protocol with a simple
function However it is an important primitive because any secure computation
can be based on OT  		
 It is considered a universal primitive for crypto
graphic functionalities where the users do not fully trust each other
In the rst OT system introduced by Rabin 
 a message is received with
probability 	 and the sender does not know whether the message reaches the
other side Even et al dened the 	outof OT 
 where the sender has two
secrets and the receiver can choose one of them in an oblivious manner That is
the sender cannot know the receivers choice and the receiver cannot know more
than one of the senders secrets The 	outof OT is equivalent to the Rabin
OT 	
 Also we may assume that the senders secrets are onebit messages in
	outof OT because the case with string messages is reducible to it eciently


By simple arguments it can be shown that OT cannot achieve informa
tion theoretic security for both parties over a standard noiseless communication
channel If a noisy channel of certain form is available between the sender and
the receiver OT can be constructed with unconditional security   	
 While
OT based on noisy channels with transmission errors are relatively wellstudied
in 	 Palmieri and Pereira 
 proposed a new scheme using a completely dif
ferent source of channel randomness In their paper the channel does not have
 KaiYuen Cheong and Atsuko Miyaji
any error on the content but a transmission delay This seems to be a remark
ably weaker assumption than the noisy channel and random channel delays are
abundant in media like the Internet
In 
 a semihonest OT protocol is proposed where the parties follow the
protocol strictly but may try to compute more information afterwards from the
communication transcript In this paper we improve it by removing the semi
honest assumption The nal protocol is unconditionally secure Some techniques
we use are from the standard ones 
 for general OT enhancement
Our paper is organized as follows Section  describes the preliminaries in
cluding the assumptions about the channel used and the denition of OT In Sec
tion  we describe a basic protocol which only works in the semihonest model
similar to the protocol in 
 The main contribution of this paper is shown in
Section  where we provided the fully secure protocol before the conclusion in
Section 
 Preliminaries
?? Delay Channel
Following the tracks of 
 we rst dene the properties of the channel called
the binary discretetime delaying channel BDDC In this model the channel
accepts binary strings called packets and delivers them with some delay It is
a memoryless channel such that delays happen to each packet independently
according to certain known probabilistic distribution The channel operates at
discrete times such that there is a xed set of allowed time for transmitting
and receiving the packets A packet always arrives as a whole at the same time
without being broken into parts The channel has no other forms of errors
A delay probability is denoted by p with p  	 We assume that p is
publicly known and set q  	 ?? p Neither the sender nor the receiver gets
any feedback information about the delay that occurred The BDDC has the
following properties
	 There is a discrete either nite or innite set of allowed input times T 
ft?? t g and output times U  fu?? u g
 A packet sent at ti will arrive at ui if there is no delay Otherwise it will
arrive at uj with probability pij A packet may delay once with probability
p and is subject to further delays with the same probability Therefore for
j  i we have pij  pj??i ?? pj??i For j  i pij  
It is clear that pii  q denotes the probability that the packet arrives on time
The assumption that p  	 can generally be justied First p should be low
for an ecient channel Also in reality time is an analog quantity and the mean
and variance of the actual delay can be used to derive the interval in which the
packet is expected to arrive with high probability In 
 it is also assumed that
p  	

???? Oblivious Transfer
In this paper the 	outof bit OT with perfect security is dened as
	 The sender Alice inputs a pair of secret bits s?? s and the receiver Bob
inputs a choice bit c
 Correctness If both Alice and Bob are honest Bob outputs sc and Alice
outputs nothing
 Security for Alice Regardless of Bobs actions if Alice is honest there exists
c  f 	g such that Bob receives zero information of sc?? 
 Security for Bob If Bob is honest Alice receives zero information on c re
gardless of her actions
In the case where the properties above are not perfectly satised if the failure
probability for each of them is negligible we say that the OT protocol is uncon
ditionally secure A protocol is said to be in the semihonest model if all parties
are assumed to follow the protocol Otherwise it is in the malicious model where
the cheating party does not need to follow the protocol Therefore security in
the malicious model is strictly stronger than security in semihonest model
 A building block protocol
 Semihonest OT
In this part we introduce a protocol similar to 
 It is a semihonest OT pro
tocol A small modication is made to reduce the communication cost Impact
to security is basically none but the analysis becomes easier in our version The
change is that we set the variables ei to be one bit rather than a general binary
string Our version of the protocol is
	 For security parameter n Alice prepares random bits e e en For con
venience n is an even number For 	  i  n she prepares vi  ijjei which is
the string created by the concatenation of index i and bit ei Next she also
creates v
i  ijj	 ?? ei
 At time t?? Alice sends all vi to the BDDC At time t she sends all v
i Each
of vi and v
i is treated as one packet in the BDDC channel
 At time u?? Bob receives the packets coming from the BDDC If fewer than
n packets are received Bob aborts the protocol
 Otherwise Bob randomly selects a set of indices Ic  f	    ng where c is
his OT choice bit under the condition that jIcj  n and Bob has received
a string in the form ijj at u?? for all i  Ic He sets I??c to be the set of all
i  f	    ng such that i  Ic
 Bob sends I?? I over a clear channel to Alice If there are no other channels
the BDDC can also be used for this purpose In either case we do not add
extra assumptions about the properties of the channels used in the protocol

 Bob knows ei whenever i  Ic He computes c  LiIc
ei and nally
sc  c  c
In essence in the protocol vi is a random message Alice sends to Bob and v
i is
for confusion such that Bob will not be able to get Alices message if he gets vi
and v
i at the same time Thus the setting has the feature of Rabin OT 	
 It is
then used to construct the 	outof OT in the standard way
?? Security in the semihonest model
Following the denition of OT the proof of security properties and functionality
is divided into three parts correctness security for Alice and security for Bob
Correctness If both parties are honest the packets sent at t?? follows a
binomial distribution regarding to whether they are delayed or not Failure hap
pens when there are not enough packets received at u?? Same as 
 we use
the Hoedings inequality to see that the upper bound of failure probability is
e??n 

??p
 As it decreases exponentially with the increase of n we can say that
it is negligible
Alices security We can show that the protocol is secure even against
a malicious Bob which is stronger than the semihonest Bob To simplify the
analysis further let us assume that the malicious Bob is equipped with a special
power whenever a packet is received at or after u Bob can tell the time that
the packet in question is sent Therefore the only uncertainty is on the packets
received at u which may be sent at t?? or t Note that the real Bob has no such
power and is thus strictly weaker
For any i if both vi and v
i are received at u they are indistinguishable to
Bob and he would have zero information on ei For one i the probability for this
to happen is pq Therefore the probability that it never happens for 	  i  n
is 	 ?? pqn Note that this probability falls exponentially with n
Otherwise there exists at least one i such that Bob has zero information on
ei Since either i  I?? or i  I it is ensured that there exists c such that Bob
cannot get sc?? 
Bobs security If Alice follows the protocol it is clear that she cannot get
any information about c because all possible sets of I?? I are equally likely
Therefore the protocol is perfectly secure against the semihonest Alice
Unconditionally Secure Oblivious Transfer Based on Channel Delays 
 Constructing the full protocol
 Insecurity of the basic protocol
The problem with the semihonest protocol is that when Alice is malicious it is
insecure Note that Alice will not send the same packet twice or send something
with incorrect format because they are detectable with absolute certainty On
the other hand the honest Bob does not need to look at packets arriving at u
or later in the protocol so Alice also does not need to care about what she sends
to the BDDC at time t and after Moreover Alice cannot gain any information
about c after the last message from Bob Therefore it is clear that the malicious
Alice will only focus on adding or deleting messages to be sent at t?? in the
following manner For each i essentially there are only three possible deviations
from the protocol
	 Alice sends v
i instead of vi at t??
 Alice sends both vi and v
i at t??
 Alice sends neither vi nor v
i at t??
The rst case cannot cause any harm to Bob as it is equivalent to ipping the
randomly chosen ei before the protocol begins For the second case Bob can
detect it with probability q by seeing both vi and v
i at u?? This is a weak
attack but not to be ignored The third case is a strong attack which leaves the
scheme completely broken Bob will not detect anything wrong and it becomes
certain that i  I??c Therefore Alice can get Bobs choice c with absolute
certainty at zero risk These problems are to be solved in the full protocol
?? The enhancement scheme
Using a method in 
 any OT scheme can be used k times as subprotocols
to build a stronger OT for Bobs security against the malicious Alice At the
end only the XOR value of all the Bobs choice bits is his real choice For
completeness we describe the general method here
	 At the beginning Alice has OT input fs?? sg while Bob has a choice c
 Alice generates a list of k ?? 	 random bits ?? ??   ??k??
 Alice chooses ??k such that Lk
i ??i  s??
 Alice sets the second list of bits as i  ??i  s??  s for all i
 The two parties run k copies of the subprotocol OT For each i they use it
to transfer the pair ??i i
 Bob makes the choices randomly except that the XOR of all choices repre
sents the real choice c That is denoting the choices in the OT subprotocols
by ci we have
k
M
i
ci  c 

 The nal output of the receiver is sc as it can be computed from
sc 
k
M
i
cii 
In this enhancement scheme if Alice wants to guess c she has to guess each of
the ci correctly Therefore it can enhance Bobs security such that only one of
the subprotocols needs to be secure for Bob
But in our case using this enhancement only does not give a secure protocol
from the semihonest protocol because the semihonest protocol is completely
insecure for Bob Some extras measures are required to build a full OT scheme
 The complete protocol
In our full protocol we set k  n Alice and Bob run k times the semihonest
OT using it as a subprotocol The idea is that for each subprotocol Bob
records the number of packets received at u?? If Alice cheats by sending neither
vi nor v
i for at least one i the expected number of packets received at u?? drops
to qn ?? 	 or below from the value of nq in the honest case To distinguish the
two distributions we use the midpoint qn ?? 
 of the two mean values After
seeing all k subprotocols Bob aborts the main protocol if there are more than
k subprotocols where the number of packets received at u?? is below qn?? 
 
The full protocol is
	 The k subprotocols to be run in parallel are indexed by j Alice prepares a
matrix of random bits eij for 	  i  n and 	  j  k and sets vij  jjjijjeij 
She also sets v
ij  jjjijj	 ?? eij 
 Alice sends all vij to the BDDC at t?? and all v
ij at t
 Bob waits to receive all packets and records their time of arrival He checks
for basic consistency such that for every i and j he receives both jjjijj and
jjjijj	 for exactly once each He also checks that he does not receive both
jjjijj and jjjijj	 at u?? He aborts the protocol if any of these tests fail
 Otherwise Bob sets a counter X   and enter the following procedure For
	  j  k he records the number of packets in format jjj received in u??
For any j if this number is smaller than n Bob aborts the protocol If it
is larger than n but smaller than qn ?? 

 Finishing the procedure above Bob aborts the protocol if X 	 k

 Security analysis
As usual the proof of security is divided into correctness Alices security and
Bobs security Relying on the security of the subprotocol we show that the
complete protocol has negligible failure probabilities in these three aspects
Correctness Observe that when both parties are honest correctness is en
sured if Bob does not abort the protocol In this case Bob may abort the protocol
in two possible ways The rst possibility is at least one of the k subprotocols
has more than n delayed packets By the union bound the probability for this
is bounded by
ne??n 

??p

which is negligible in n Next the second possibility to abort is that X 	 k
 For
one subprotocol regarding to the probability of having the number of packets
received at u?? to be below qn ?? 
  the Hoedings inequality gives the upper
bound as

n  
Note that this quantity increases with n This is because when n is larger the
variance of the number of delayed packets is also larger Next we deal with the
total number of such cases in the k runs of the subprotocol Setting

Therefore the value of e??k
falls exponentially in n Thus the correctness of
the nal protocol is established
Alices security By union bound the probability of failure in Alices secu
rity in the nal protocol is no more than k times that of the subprotocol That
is it is upper bounded by n	 ?? pqn This quantity drops exponentially in n
too
Bobs security The malicious Alice must be dishonest in every subprotocol
in order to have any hope to get information on c Security is perfect for Bob
otherwise Recall that Alice can only do the following for cheating
	 For some i j Alice sends both vij and v
ij at t??
 For some i j Alice sends neither vij nor v
ij at t??
We argue that for the rst type of cheating if Alice sends both vij and v
ij at t??
this behavior will be detected with probability q Therefore Alice can only do
this a few times To be more precise let us assume that Alice does this m times
It is clear that m  n or the probability of detection will be overwhelming with
the increase of n On the other hand for the second type of cheating if Alice
sends neither vij nor v
ij at t?? it will not be detected immediately Let us assume
that Alice is doing this m times In order to gain any real advantage she has
to do at least one of either types of cheating in every subprotocol Therefore
m 	 k ?? n and there are at least k ?? n subprotocols where only the second
type of cheating occurs
Focusing on such cases the chance for that subprotocol to have more than
qn ?? 

In the protocol to deter Alice from cheating Bob aborts if X 	 k

that X can reach k

the rest With the Hoedings inequality the probability that X fails to reach

 Conclusion
With failure probabilities on correctness Alices security and Bobs security
being negligible in n we obtain the unconditionally secure OT protocol Our
protocol is the rst to give unconditionally security in OT using channel delays
The practical value of our protocol is still limited because accurate knowledge of
p is required for Bobs security Relaxing of this nontrivial assumption would be
interesting for future study Also this protocol relies on the BDDC model We
believe a scheme based on the real analog time channel delay may be possible
The nal communication overhead of our protocol is On	 log n for security
parameter n This is rather high and it would be better if it can be reduced
